# Stylish Text Generator

Use the generated text for shit like Instagram where you're not allowed to use mockup. Here because (a) I'm lazy to Google existing ones and (b) I cannot stand the modern web app.

Will do letters and numbers: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890`

## Development

This is my first Svelte project!

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start live-reloading server
yarn dev

# Clean
yarn clean

# Build
yarn build
```

## TODO

Could not find a way to change the `publicPath` without looking at Svelte CLI (which mentions... Vue?) and SvelteKit which seems complicated. Might have to do this with Rollup.
